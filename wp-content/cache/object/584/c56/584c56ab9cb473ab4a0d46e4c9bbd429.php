Having been seen in the hands on some of the most influential bassists of the past five and a half decades, the Gibson SG Bass is a mainstay in the world of popular music. This phenomenal bass is back for 2019, and is as recognisable today as it was when Jack Bruce, Bill Wyman, and John Entwhistle first appeared on stage with theirs.
<h3>Lightweight, Comfortable, and Hard-Rockin'!</h3>
With the new Gibson SG Standard Bass you get that same familiar look and feel that we've grown accustomed to. This bass features a solid Mahogany body, short-scale rounded Mahogany neck, Rosewood fingerboard, 3-point adjustable bridge, premium-grade electronics, and a pair of specially voiced humbuckers.

If you want your bass to look great, sound great, and feel great, then this is the instrument for you!
<h4>Vintage Rock Bass Sound</h4>
Whilst not as bright and articulate as other pickups, the humbuckers in this SG Standard Bass nonetheless offer you a deep and rumbling bass sound that's ever-present in the mix without ever being overbearing. You can clean the tone up with ease thanks to the addition of a bridge-position mini-humbucker, but at its heart this bass is perfect for playing vintage and modern rock!
<h4>Rock-Solid Construction</h4>
With it's sleek and comfortable neck, along with a surprisingly slim and lightweight construction, similar to its 6-string SG counterpart, the Gibson SG Standard Bass not only sounds great but offers an incredible playing experience. Whether you're sitting on a stool in the studio, or rocking out in front of 20 people in your local pub, this bass sits comfortably against your body comfortably with ease, making the time just fly by.
