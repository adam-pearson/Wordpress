<h3>Hard-Rocking, Super-Playable Bass at a Great Price!</h3>
In addition to the lightweight double-cutaway body design, the Epiphone EB-3 is equipped with a long-scale neck. This neck ensures the bass delivers a superb amount of natural sustain, as well as articulate tone.

This sleek, 34" scale, slim-taper neck fits easily into your hand, making the EB-3 ideal for relative beginners as well as guitarists looking to make the switch into low-end territory.
<h4>Vintage EB-Tone</h4>
Part of the EB-3's charm has always been the smooth, no-nonesense tones it produces. This is down to the combination of a Sidewinder humbucker at the neck, and that famous NYT mini-humbucker at the bridge.

These pickups perfectly compliment the natural tonal properties of the Mahogany body, which results in a thunderous array of bass tones suited to pretty much any style of music.

In addition to this, there's a cool, vintage-style 3-way rotary selector which alters the frequency response of the bass, giving you a wide array of tonal options to play with.
