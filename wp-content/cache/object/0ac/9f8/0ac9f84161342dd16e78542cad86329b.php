<h3>Affordable And Versatile - What More Could You Want?</h3>
Originally introduced to the world in 1960 under the moniker Deluxe Model, the Fender Jazz bass was soon renamed and, due to its thinner and more-rounded neck than the P-Bass, marketed towards Jazz musicians. This dual single-coil design has stood the test of time, and is still one of the world's most popular bass guitars, almost six decades after its introduction.

With this Player Series Jazz Bass you get an inspiring instrument, that features the classic, elevated style and authentic Fender bass tone as its predecessors, but like the Standard Series before it, this bass can be yours for an incredible price.

In fact, you'd struggle to find a particular playing style that this bass isn't suitable for!
