Precision Bass or Jazz Bass ‚Äì Get You a Bass That Can Do Both

Originally introduced back in 1964, the Mustang bass has been hugely popular for over fifty years, due in no small part to its versatility and has been used by bassists in a variety of bands including such diverse acts as The Rolling Stones and My Chemical Romance.
<h4>Classic Mustang Style Modernised</h4>
Alder has been used to craft the classic Mustang style body shape which features a handy double cutaway design, providing easy access to the upper frets ‚Äì perfect for solos and adventurous bass lines.

Sturdy bolt-on construction joins a Maple neck to the Mustang Bass PJ, enhancing mid-range punch.

The Mustang Bass also features Fender‚Äôs classic short scale length of 30‚Äù, making it smaller you‚Äôre your usual bass guitars which come in 34‚Äù scale.

This shorter scale length aids playability, particular for beginner bassists and smaller players but it‚Äôs also great for anyone who enjoys that easier reach. Tonal is also enhanced with the Mustang PJ Bass having a tighter top end, more pronounced low end and a scoop in the mid-range.

The Pau Ferro fretboard has a 9.5‚Äù radius and holds 19 medium jumbo frets along with simple white dot position inlays.
<h4>Vintage Style Electronics</h4>
Delivering fantastically versatile sound, the Fender Mustang Bass comes with a PJ pickup configuration.

A Vintage Style split single-coil Precision Bass pickup has been installed in the middle pickup position while a Vintage Style single-coil Jazz Bass pickup can be found in the bridge pickup position.

Select either of the pickups individually or a combination of the two using the three-way pickup selector switch, while two control knobs in the form of Vintage Style black Jazz Bass knobs allow you to adjust the Master Volume and Master Tone.
<h4>High Quality Hardware</h4>
Four Fender Vintage Style tuning machines with open gear construction can be found at the headstock, providing precise and secure tuning along with some retro visual flair.

A four-saddle hardtail bridge provides precise intonation and solid tuning stability while increasing sustain.

For an extra touch of class, the Mustang Bass has a special neck plate that has been engraved with the classic Fender ‚ÄúF‚Äù logo.
<h4>Timeless Style and Versatility</h4>
Hugely popular across the globe for more than five decades, the Mustang Bass is one of Fender‚Äôs most enduring bass designs.

Awesome visual presence and excellent Fender craftsmanship along with vintage style pickups in a fantastically versatile PJ configuration makes the Fender Mustang Bass PJ a real all-rounder workhorse bass guitar.
