A new entry into the Fender lineup for 2018 is the fantastic Player Series. This range of guitars and basses offer players an array of affordable options for their first, second or even third foray into the world of Fender instruments.

Whether it's a Strat, Tele, Jazz Bass or P-Bass you want, the Fender Player Series has you covered!
<h3>The Most Popular Bass of All Time</h3>
Initially introduced to the world in 1951, the Fender Precision Bass represents a milestone in stringed instrument amplification. More than six decades later, and these incredible instruments are still amongst the most popular bass guitars on the market.

With their rock-solid playability and thunderous bass tones emanating from that familiar Split Single Coil P-Bass Pickup, the Fender Precision bass is suitable for a wide range of musical genres and playstyles, and has been seen in the hands of some of the world's most prominent bassists over the decades.

<strong>A Dream to Play</strong>

Featuring a comfortable Alder body, smooth "C"-shaped maple neck with maple fingerboard, a Tidepool finish over the body, and an all-new Player Series Split Coil P-Bass pickup, this Fender Player Series Precision Bass is a stunning homage to one of the most iconic electric instruments ever made.

<strong>Ready to Rock</strong>

One of the stand-out qualities of the P-Bass over the years has been the rock-solid construction: picking one up and playing it makes you feel like you're playing an instrument that was built to rock. This tradition is continued with the Player Series Precision Bass, thanks to the comfortable "C" Shaped neck profile and curvy Alder body - there's just something about it that makes you want to play loud and proud!

<strong>Stand-Out Voice</strong>

Originally designed to offer the clear high-end of a single coil pickup, but without any of the associated 60 cycle hum, the P-Bass Split Coil pickup is a feat of audio engineering that's second to none. With its tonally rich and thunderous low-end accompanying those articulate highs, it's clear to see and hear just why the P-Bass has been the instrument of choice for the likes of James Jamerson, John Paul Jones, Pino Paladino, and even Geezer Butler over the past six decades.
