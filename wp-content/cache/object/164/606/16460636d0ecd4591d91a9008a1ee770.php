<h4>Crafting The American Ultra P-Bass</h4>
Fender's American Ultra series has been designed to, quite simply, be the company's most advancedÂ lineup of guitars and basses to date.

WithÂ this P-Bass you get a modern, high-performance take onÂ theÂ quintessential 4-string - a bass designed forÂ the players who demand the very best in terms of tone, versatility, and playability.

For starters, there's a lightweight Alder body, carved with that familiar dual-cutaway design, andÂ sporting a cool-looking Mocha Burst finish.

Attached to the body you'll find a Maple neck with a unique "Modern D" profile, rolled fretboard edges, a tapered neck heel, and a fast-playing compound-radius fingerboard.

The end result is a high-performanceÂ bass that's suitable for any playstyle - the kind you could perform with repeatedly with the minal amount of hand-fatigue, whilst retaining that familiar solid P-Bass feel.
<h4>Ultra Noiseless</h4>
To deliver the ultimate tonal experience, the American Ultra series features newly-designed Ultra Noiseless pickups - in this case a Split Coil P-bass pickup, and a Single Coil J-Bass bridge position pickup.

In addition to the renowned combination of hum-free P-Bass and J-Bass tones, the American Ultra Precision Bass is equipped with cutting-edge wiring options.

This wiring offers accurate Cut/Boost options for the Bass, Middle, and Treble frequency ranges, along with a Master Volume, Pan Pot (for pickup selection), and even an Active/Passive mini-toggle, giving you a huge array of tonal options at your disposal.
<h4>Premium-Grade Hardware</h4>
As a finishing touch, this American Ultra Precision Bass comes equipped with premium-quality hardware to offer levels of stability and reliability that are second-to-none.

This includes a set of light-weight, vintage-style tuners, along with a 4-saddle HiMass bridge, which come together to offer incredible levels of tuning stabilityÂ andÂ pin-pointÂ accurate intonation.
