<h3>A classic 60's bass that anyone can afford!</h3>
Thanks to their partnership with Gibson, Epiphone have been able to re-issue some of the most classic guitars ever made. The EB-0 bass is no different - drawing from the iconic 60s solidbody design of the SG, incorporated into a 4-string bass. A shorter 30.5" scale length means that even smaller or first-time players can appreciate its feel and comfort, without compromise to tone, set-up or style.

The benchmark performance and rich tone of the EB0 is down to the shorter scale length. Not only does it make it much more playable for smaller or younger players, it gives this bass a unique rock 'growl' thanks to the shorter strings.

Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones, Jack Bruce from Cream, and John Entwistle from The Who have all found a place in their hearts for the EB-0 SG Bass. If it's good enough for these rock icons, it's good enough for us!
